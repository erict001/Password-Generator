# Password-Generator

## Description
This application generates a password on every button click. This application would be useful for anyone that is looking to create random passwords. 

When I was building this application, I had difficulty on deciding which direction to go with how the user should submit their requests for lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numbers criteria. Once that decision was made, through the help of our study group, then I was able to successfully make progress in the direction of this assignment. 

In the future, I would like to add some styling and I would rather the prompts show up on the page as opposed to elements attached to the browser. 

## How to use the project
When the user loads the application, they are prompted with a button to generate their password. Once the user clicks on the button, the password generates a password length between 8 and 128 characters. Once they have input a required amount of characters, they have to choose from either lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and/or numbers to help build their random password generator. To choose each input, click "ok" to signal yes and click "cancel" for no. 

Once all of the elements are responded to, a random password is generated in the text box matching the criteria that you requested.
