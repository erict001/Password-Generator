# Password-Generator

## Description
This application generates a password on every button click. This application would be useful for anyone that is looking to create random passwords. 

When I was building this application, I had difficulty on deciding which direction to go with how the user should submit their requests for lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numbers criteria. Once that decision was made, through the help of our study group, then I was able to successfully make progress in the direction of this assignment. 

In the future, I would like to fix the minimum of 8 characters and maximum of 128 characters. 

## How to use the project
When the user loads the application, they are prompted with a button to generate their password. Once the user clicks on the button, the password generates a password length between 8 and 128 characters.
